        <h2>What is BullHacks</h2>
        <p>BullHacks is a 24-hour MLH hackathon. We want to make students aware of the skills they already posses and guide them to build cool, fun and innovative ideas in a short amount of time.</p>

        <h2>Wait, what is a "hackathon"?</h2>
        <p>Don't worry, hackathons are completely legal, and don't involve breaking into any systems! They are really just playgrounds for inventors, tinkerers and coders: where people like you create and innovate. Once the 24 hours are up, you get to demonstrate what you have built; and we've got awesome prizes for the best hacks!</p>

        <h2>But what if I can't code?</h2>
        <p>We want you to come along anyway! Regardless of what you think of your technical skills, we're absolutely sure you'll contribute loads! We've also got mentors at the event who are there specifically to help you turn your ideas into a reality. We will be running technical workshops throughout the event, so, if you've always wanted to learn how to code, or if you want to see how technology can be applied to the real world, this is your perfect opportunity!</p>

        <h2>Can I come?</h2>
        <p>As long as you are over 18, and currently in full time education (yes, Postgraduates, too), we would love to see you at Durhack! Please bring your student ID to the event; they will be checked.</p>

        <h2>When and where will it be?</h2>
        <p>BullHacks will be held on March 11th through 12th at Birmingham City University. Our hacking space will be located at the city center campus in The Cuzon Building</p>

        <h2>Help! I don't have a team!</h2>
        <p>That's okay! If you don't have a team, just take part in the icebreaker event at the start of the hack; there, you can pitch your ideas to others, or join another to help build a great idea. It's a great place to meet people, but if you're more of a lone wolf, you're more than welcome to hack on your own, too!</p>

        <h2>What should I bring?</h2>
        <p>You'll need to bring your student ID, a laptop, any device you think you will need, chargers, and your creativity!</p>
        <p>P/S: You could also bring a fresh set of clothes and a pillow, if you want to be more comfortable.</p>

        <p>Not at all; BullHacks is absolutely FREE! We are kindly funded by some awesome sponsors, and thanks to them, we can provide you with power, swag, and food, so you don't have to spend a penny once you're here. Unfortunately, we are not able to provide any travel reimbursements at this time.</p>
